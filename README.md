# Bank-Branch-Sales-Management-System
The Bank Branch Sales Management System (BBSMS) starts when the lending entity receives a product request and continues
all the way until the product is approved or rejected. The system guides you through each step of the loan product origination 
process and explains how to use various techniques to overcome the disadvantages of the lengthy paper trail process. An ER diagram
of the BBSMS shows basic information about the bank, including entities such as branches, customers, target, transactions, staff decisions,
transaction flow, and products.
